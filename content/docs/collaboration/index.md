Collaboration on snapsite

To collaborate on a snapsite, you should invite your colleagues. You can invite them through their role, we have the following roles:
- Owner  
The person who setted up the organisation, manages billings and is allowed for dangerous operations such as deleting the entire organisation.
- Manager  
A person who is allowed to manage other members of the organisation, create and delete building sites.
- Editor  
A person who is allowed to add and modify the content of a building site, such as folders and files.
- Shooter  
A person who is allowed to add photos. 
- Viewer  
A person who is allowed to only see the data.

You can add a collaborator for the entire organisation or for a single building site or folder.
